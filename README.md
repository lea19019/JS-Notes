# JS Journey Overview

It was around January 2020 when I had my first contact with JavaScript, I wrote several exercises to help me undestand general programming concepts
such as for loops, data types, logical operators, etc. I remember thinking JS was a lot easier than C++ (the firs language I learned), but 
due to my curriculum I sttoped my JS learning on those months. It wasn't until April 2021 I continued my journey learning this wonderful language, this
repository contains notes, projects and examples I wrote during my learning. Hopefully you can find something useful here!

# Web Pages

As part of my journey I created two SPA (Single Page Apps) with just JavaSript.

The first one is a To Do App that will allow the user to create, read, update and delete tasks with the help of local storage.
